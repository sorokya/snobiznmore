Hey all! Snobiz opening tomorrow! May 9th at 3 PM. Same hours as last year.

Mon-Sat 3 PM to 8 PM.

Unfortunately we ran out of peppermint. So no more Peach Snapps, Cool Lemon, Peppermint Patty or other minty flavors.

But! The good news is we’re getting cheesecake soon. So you’ll be to combine any flavor you want with cheesecake! Blue berry, cherry, black berry, who knows.

Can’t wait to see you! Come and get your snobiz :)
